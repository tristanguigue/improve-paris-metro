        <h3>{% trans "Why removing stations?"%}</h3>
        <p>{% trans " Paris metro is over a hundred years old and the first lines were built when the city extended little behind its administrative border. Today Paris is a metropolis of over 12 millions inhabitants, among those only 2.2m live in the city proper. The metro has expanded into its suburbs and further expansions are planned."%}</p>
        <p>{% trans " However travelling accross Paris with the metro can be slow due to the density of stations: the average distance between stations is 570 meters compared to 1200m for the world average and the average commercial speed across the network is only 27km/h. As a consequence trains almost never reach their maximum speed. For example it takes 52 minutes on line 9 to cover the 19.5km between Pont de SÃ¨vre and Montreuil compared to 29 minutes for the Victoria line in London for 21km."%}</p>

This is also true, which is why the Grand Paris Express lines are being built. However it should be possible to use the historical network beyond its current use for short-trip within Paris. The RER and Grand Paris Express alone cannot cater the 12 millions inhabitans of  greater Paris, the existing network should be able to contribute to serve the densily populated inner suburbs as long as travel times stay acceptable."%}</li>
